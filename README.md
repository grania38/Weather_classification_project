The Weather Classification Project aims to use these technological advancements to develop a robust system for weather classification based on visual data. 
By utilizing deep learning techniques, the project seeks to categorize images into distinct weather categories that are: cloudy, rainy, shine, and sunrise conditions.
The dataset is downloaded from "https://github.com/IMobinI/Weather-Classification"
I used the CNN for classification.
